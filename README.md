### Libraries Needed:
   * nltk
   * pandas
   * sklearn
   * numpy
   * scipy


### Note:
  The code was run and executed in both Jupyter notebook as well as Spyder IDEs. It is assumed that the user has installed anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. Open the anaconda IDE, then click on install for jupyternotebook or spyder by clicking at the install button if not installed. If already installed click 'launch'.

If anaconda is not installed follow the below Environment setting steps:

### Envirnoment Setting Up steps:
   1)Install anaconda IDE if not already installed. Go to website https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and install the anaconda IDE.
   
   2)install python latest version
   
   3)open anaconda shell and type 
conda install -c anaconda nltk
type 'y' and press ENTER.

### For running code on Spyder

   4) Open Spyder IDE 
   
   5)In console type: 
import nltk
nltk.download()

then NLTK downloader pop-up will show on screen select all the install all nltk libraries, if already installed nltk library please do not do this step.

   6) Load the code .py file. And click on run button. Results will be displayed in Console.

### For running code on Jupyter Notebook:

   4) Open Jupyter notebook from anaconda. 
   
   5)If using nltk for the 1st time type and run:
import nltk
nltk.download()
	If already installed nltk library please ignore this step.
    6) Load the file named as .ipynb and click on 'restart the kernel, and re-run the whole code'. Results will be displayed in Console.

### What is this repository for? ###

* It contains the Screenshots and results obtained for the speech processing project. In this code assignment various concepts of NLP as well speech processing were used. Ultimately, the audio file is ploted in terms of freq plots, heatmaps, etc.
